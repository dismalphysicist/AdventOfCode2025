# Advent of Code 2025

I will be attempting [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) again this year. It has changed to 12 days, which is approximately how long I usually last in any case, so hoping to finish it this year. I'll be using Python since I don't have time to learn another language. I'll be attempting to use a mathsy solution rather than a brute-force solution wherever I think of one.

**Note**: the author of AoC has [requested](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about) that people do not add their puzzle input, or parts of the puzzle text, to public repositories, so if you want to try out my solutions you'll have to log in and get your own puzzle inputs.i
